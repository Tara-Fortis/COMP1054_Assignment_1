                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Are you gonna see me when light gets dark? <br/>
                    The sun goes down over Gramercy Park<br/>
                    And it's become easy to hide pieces away<br/>
                    Making up someone in the hope that you'll stay<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    'Cause I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be<br/>
                    I've been doing all the things that I think you wanna see<br/>
                    I've been trying to fulfill you with your every need<br/>
                    Now you falling for a person that's not even me<br/>
                    Said you falling for a person that's not even me (Gimme the beat)<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Post-Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    Mmm, mmm<br/>
                    Mmm, mmm (Gimme the beat)<br/>
                    Mmm, mmm<br/>
                    Now you falling for a person that's not even me<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't get me wrong, I wasn't out to deceive<br/>
                    I like the attention with your eyes on me<br/>
                    The trouble with the truth is it's so hard to believe<br/>
                    Now, here I stand with my heart on my sleeve<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Post-Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    Mmm, mmm<br/>
                    Mmm, mmm (Gimme the beat)<br/>
                    Mmm, mmm<br/>
                    Now you falling for a person that's not even me<br/>
                    Now you falling for a person that's not even me<br/>
                    'Cause I forgot about the person that I used to be<br/>
                </p>

            <h4>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
            <!-- add a paragraph about the artist -->
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
