                        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                        <p>
                            Are you gonna see me when light gets dark? <br/>
                            The sun goes down over Gramercy Park <br/>
                            And it's become easy to hide pieces away <br/>
                            Making up someone in the hope that you'll stay <br/>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            'Cause I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be <br/>
                            I've been doing all the things that I think you wanna see <br/>
                            I've been trying to fulfill you with your every need <br/>
                            Now you falling for a person that's not even me <br/>
                            Said you falling for a person that's not even me (Gimme the beat) <br/>

                            Mmm, mmm <br/>
                            Now you falling for a person that's not even me <br/>

                            Don't get me wrong, I wasn't out to deceive <br/>
                            I like the attention with your eyes on me <br/>
                            The trouble with the truth is it's so hard to believe <br/>
                            Now, here I stand with my heart on my sleeve <br/>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Post-Chorus</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mmm, mmm <br/>
                            Mmm, mmm (Gimme the beat) <br/>
                            Mmm, mmm <br/>
                            Now you falling for a person that's not even me <br/>
                            Now you falling for a person that's not even me <br/>
                            'Cause I forgot about the person that I used to be <br/>

                <p>
                    When I first heard this song, I thought it was about a woman changing who she is to be what her partner wants her to be. But now I think it is more about how fame forces artists to change who they are to fit into what their fans want them to be, that the person that the audience sees is a reflection of what they want to see.
